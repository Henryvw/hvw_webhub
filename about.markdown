				About
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				I’m an entrepreneur, writer, pianist, coder and artist living in Berlin, Germany.
			</p>
			<p>
				My key project is <a href="http://baugarten.app"> Baugarten, the world-building computer game that teaches algebra</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My other projects include <a href="https://www.stoicpenknife.com">Stoic Penknife</a>, <a href="../projects/salons">philosophy salons</a>, and <a href="../projects/dudendudes">our creative <i>Wohngemeinschaft</i></a>. We discontinued <a href="../projects/office">our office project in Berlin</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can read <a href="../curriculum vitae.html">here about my past work experiences</a>. I’ve harvested broccoli in Denmark, interned for the Taiwanese government, sailed as a tall-ship deckhand from Hawaii to California, interned at the White House, worked in sales in New York, studied ancient philosophy for a year alone in a cottage, managed a restaurant, sold my first startup, managed a team of Philippines programmers while living on their island and freelanced as a programmer for many of Berlin’s largest startups.
			</p>
			<p>
			I’ve studied Mandarin Chinese at Middlebury College, business at Universität Würzburg and Liberal Arts -- majoring in English and minoring in Economics -- at Davidson College. I'm fluent in spoken and written German. I hold dual United States and EU (Italian) citizenship.
			</p>
			<p>
			My heroes are Goethe, Churchill and DaVinci. All three men were artists of words, pictures, and their own lives.
