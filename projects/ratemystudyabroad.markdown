John Henry and I started RateMyStudyAbroad in response to our mixed study abroad experiences (I had a bad one). We decided to create a worldwide resource for students to read about and write reviews about their own study abroad programs. What an adventure that led us to! We soon forged a strategic partnership with the world's largest study, work, volunteer and meaningful travel resource, <a href="https://www.GoAbroad.com">GoAbroad.com</a>, based in Colorado and in the Philippines. 

GoaAbroad bought RateMyStudyAbroad in 2014.
