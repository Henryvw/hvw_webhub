  <p>
    I’m an entrepreneur living in Berlin, Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    My key project is <a href="http://baugarten.app"> Baugarten, the world-building computer game that teaches algebra</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My other projects include <a href="https://www.stoicpenknife.com">Stoic Penknife</a>, <a href="../projects/salons">philosophy salons</a>, and <a href="../projects/wohngemeinschaft">our creative <i>Wohngemeinschaft</i></a>. We discontinued <a href="../projects/office">our office project in Berlin</a>.

  <p>
    You can read <a href="../CV">here about my past work experiences</a>. I’ve harvested broccoli in Denmark, interned for the Taiwanese government, sailed as a tall-ship deckhand from Hawaii to California, interned at the White House, worked in sales in New York, studied ancient philosophy for a year alone in a cottage, managed a restaurant, sold my first startup, managed a Philippines tech team while living on their island, Leyte, and freelanced as a programmer for many of Berlin’s largest startups.

  <p>
I’ve studied Mandarin Chinese at Middlebury College, business at Universität Würzburg and Liberal Arts -- majoring in English and minoring in Economics -- at Davidson College. I'm fluent in spoken and written German. I hold dual United States and EU (Italian) citizenship.

<p>
My heroes are Goethe, Churchill and DaVinci. All three men were artists of words, pictures, and their own lives.
