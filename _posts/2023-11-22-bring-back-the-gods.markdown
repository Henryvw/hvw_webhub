To portray Achilles, Athena, Agamemnon, Helen, Priam, Cassandra, Odysseus & all the gods & heroes of The Iliad via the arts of language, painting, music and sculpture -- to portray or to contemplate their emotions, their origins, their choices, and their fates -- is to engage our imaginative power in playful exploration of the infinitely different ways to live a human life. 

Gods and heroes are, in other words, an existentialist playground. 

They are extreme. Their emotions, their origins, their choices and their fates are exaggerated, because they represent the furthest possible imaginative horizons for how a human being might live his (or her) life. 

The saint is the Christian variety of hero. Saint Francis of Assisi is the Achilles of the Christian spirit. Francis' life -- its extremes -- offer us a picture of a new 'Mode' (in the Spinoza sense) of Being. Stripping himself of his riches, proposing marriage to the 'Lady Poverty', sojourning into the forest half-naked and preaching to the birds, he inspires millions to adopt an extraordinary and extreme new way of life.

Just as a child climbs the trees in his backyard to explore his environment, so all humans play with these stories to explore what to do with their own lives. His whole life Churchill keeps a bust of Napoleon on his desk because Napoleon's story offers Churchill a vision, a ‘Vorbild’ (in German: a ‘fore-picture’) of just how large one man might make his life.

Existentialist writers invent new heroic models to help us conceive of new ways to live -- new ways to think about our choices. Kierkegaard invents his 'Knight of Faith.' Nietzsche invents his ‘Übermensch.'

Naturally, many gods are not ‘Vorbilder’ in the strict sense. Their extremes reflect our fears as much as our hopes, our nightmares as much as our dreams. Yet, as our creations, do they not reflect back at us, in some rough sense, a mirror of our desires? 

The great capacity of religious practice is the shared opportunity it presents to discipline and form our characters. At its best, religious art around gods and heroes can expose us to more extravagant and rich ‘Modes’ for a human life. Religious exercises, as simple as a weekly church service or a call to prayer at dawn, can offer us shared methods to form, discipline and shape ourselves into new Modes. 

Moreover unlike Churchill's bust of Napoleon on his desk — unlike historical heroes — gods live in the realm of art. The gods offer us an opportunity to explore ways of Being whose only boundary is our artistic imagination. We can be the poets and artists of our own lives through the collective fashioning of our own gods, our own imaginative Forms & Modes of how to live. Goethe and his daimon and the extravagant artistry of the life of Saint Francis of Assisi are born from this super-natural artistic imagination. 

Just as fiction and theater give us art forms to explore ways of Being beyond the boundaries of strict reality, gods offer us a mythical space to explore who we are, what we worship, and who we (both as individuals, and, crucially, as a community) might become.

Is it an accident that the extraordinary explosion of power in Europe in the 15th-19th centuries accompanied a great artistic rebirth of the Greek & Roman gods in art? What if these new (old) gods were not just rococo dalliances, but part of a rediscovered imaginative playground for how to live?

Our models today by comparison are impoverished. To pick just one category of life that looks impoverished by comparison, take sex. Why is the poetry of Sappho, The Song of Solomon and Dante different from Tinder? What if gods like Yahweh and Eros poeticized our behavior? I think Eros transformed sex into Eroticism. As Plato writes in the Symposium, “The Lover is greater than the Beloved, because he has the god in him.” Eros is a star above sex. Under his spell, an animal drive turns into art. Living gods like Eros inject abundant extravagance into our motivations and behavior.

Mental models, it goes without saying, shape our reality. How rich and colorful is Michelangelo’s mental model of reality — compared to yours? How rich is your model of reality — compared to Homer?

Naturally I'm not the first person to point out that today youth looks to celebrities and sports stars for models (Vorbilder). We are mimetic creatures. We all search for something higher. Yet the characters we 'worship' today are small. The fastest-selling autobiography of all time is Prince Harry's new book. Can Prince Harry and his pitiful struggles capture the grandeur, romance or the horizons of the ancient gods & heroes? Our mass consumption of Harry's book proves, however, our yearning for a model. 

(Hera would have transformed Harry into a praying mantis, with all the attending consequence for the male of that species after mating with Meghan).

Another example of our worship of small Vorbilder is a second Harry found in art — Harry Potter. What do JK Rowling’s texts, films, toys and paraphernalia — the late night vigils for book releases, viewing parties and costume parties — remind you of? Today if you find yourself in a conversation with a 20-something Harry Potter-fan about the behavior of Severus Snape, you may discover a cosmos of moral exegesis worthy of a passage in scripture. The schism over JK Rowling’s tweets about women might even, in their small way, remind one of the forced side-taking in young Christian churches during the Arian or Donatist Controversies.

The moral cosmos of Harry Potter cherishes certain values like loyalty, charity and friendship that we might want to weave into new gods. At the same time, other values, — like hubris and Aristotle’s greatness-of-soul — are arguably deprecated. Could we, through conscious art, craft more wonderful gods than characters comprised of, and targeted at, children? 

Imagine, for a moment, that we have new gods. Gods created after us, yet pointing to an even greater horizon for us. Creating art toward these gods, to honor them - we honor ourselves. Via regular religious practice taking them as our Vorbilder - we discipline and cultivate ourselves. 

What might these gods look like? What would they represent? How would they be connected to the old gods? What parts would they draw inspiration from? Which parts would they throw away? 

What media and forms of art would we use to bring them to life?

What would fashion, clothing, architecture, city planning, even politics look like under their star and influence?

Liberalism was cradled within societies rich in powerful independent institutions for character-shaping and community — most prominently the church. Even today, shrinking though they are, Catholic and other religious schools remain the largest force outside of the state for character-formation in education. Is the atomization, loneliness and “Bowling Alone” so often observed in modern societies a problem that the liberal state was never designed to solve? If our old communal and character-shaping institutions are no longer fit-to-purpose and dying, is it time to turn our creative powers to give birth to new ones?

One key principle for my new pantheon would be a Heraklitean capacity for change. The Greek Pantheon needed no god for climate change. We might. Like an octopus which has its brain cells in its tentacles and in a flash metamorphoses it's body in response to touch, a democracy receives new information via votes. What if, in order to profit from distributed wisdom-of-the-crowds intelligence and tentacled information-gathering, our new pantheon was democratic? Even in the early days of the Christian church, there were many voting councils. 

The last key principle for my new gods would be that they don’t reduce us. Certain gods in the past have been used to punish people — to make them smaller. In 17th-century America a certain version of a god was used to make Hester Prynnes sew red scarlet letters into their dresses. Religions have used guilt and shame to control and diminish people's self-expression and thinking. 

Can we give birth to new gods who expand our possibilities, our imaginations and our sphere of art and action? “If not us, who? If not now, when?”
