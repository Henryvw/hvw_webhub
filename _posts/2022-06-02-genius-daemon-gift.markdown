What if I told you not only that you are gifted, but that you are a genius. What would you say? Maybe you'd ask back, 'What does it mean to be a genius? What does it mean to have a gift?'

Lewis Hyde writes in his 1979 book _The Gift_ about the roots of our modern word "genius": the Latin _genius_, or what the ancient Greeks call your _daemon_.

Today we use these words for a select type that we elevate above ourselves: "he's a genius." In the ancient world, everyone had a _genius_.

> "The task of setting free one's gifts was a recognized labor in the ancient world. The Romans called a person's tutelar spirit his _genius_. In Greece, it was called a _daemon_. Ancient authors tell us that Socrates, for example, had a _daemon_ who would speak up when he was about to do something that did not accord with his true nature. It was believed that each man had his _idios daemon_, his personal spirit which could be cultivated and developed. Apuleius, the Roman author of _The Golden Ass_, wrote a treatise on the _daemon/genius_, and one of the things he says is that in Rome it was the custom on one's birthday to offer a sacrifice to one's own _genius_. A man didn't just gifts on his birthday, he would also give something to his guiding spirit. Respected in this way the _genius_ made one 'genial' -- sexually potent, artistically creative and spiritually fertile.

> "According to Apuleius, if a man cultivated his _genius_ through such sacrifice it would become a _lar_, a protective household god, when he died. But if a man ignored his _genius_, it became a _larva_ or a _lemur_ when he died, a troublesome, restless spook that preys on the living. The _genius_ or _daemon_ comes to us at birth. It carries with it the fullness of our undeveloped powers. These it offers to us as we grow, and we choose whether or not to accept, which means we choose whether or not to labor in its service. For, again, the _genius_ has need of us. As with the elves, the spirit that brings us our gifts finds its eventual freedom only through our sacrifice, and those who do not reciprocate the gifts of their _genius_ will leave it in bondage when they die.

Philip Pullman's fantasy book _The Golden Compass_ develops these ancient ideas by describing a world in which everyone's _daemon_ is manifested as an animal that walks around with you. A bold arctic explorer's _daemon_ is a snow leopard. A journalist's is a butterfly. In each case, the animal represents the nature of your _daemon_ and what you have to give the world. Unlike adults, children's _daemons_ in his book fluctuate between different animals until the child enters puberty and settlesinto one animal representing her character. 

Apeuleius' _lar_ -- the protective household god -- or _larva_ -- or the troublesome, restless spook -- that our _genius_ becomes depending on whether we accept its gifts and labor in its service, are Dobbie the house-elf in _Harry Potter_ and his counterpart, the resentful Kreacher. If we refuse the call of our _genius_, a part of us becomes resentful. This restlessness might manifest in different ways in our life. It might be a persistent low-latency frustration or dissatisfaction. It might be an aggression we direct against the people around us, where we are not quite sure why we are being so negative - like we are casting about to find an external reason for our dissatisfaction, rather than looking inward, where we are most afraid to go. Steven Pressfield's _The War of Art_ lists the ways this "resistance" pops up: drinking, drug addiction, tumors, neuroses, painkillers, gossip and compulsive cellphone use, to name just a few. Pressfield even attributes his own marital dramas to it.

Harry Potter's Kreacher is the visualization of this _larva_ resistance. How many of us experience our worklife like Kreacher: feeling in bondage, scattering resentment in unexpected directions, because we have refused the voice inside ourselves - our inner _genius_?

Making your work into a gift doesn't mean you can't be compensated. It means that you experience and shape your work as a gift rather than a transaction. Yes, a nurse receives a paycheck. But it's in bringing her patient an extra pillow that transforms her work into a gift. A computer programmer solving an intricate debugging riddle is getting paid - but in solving a problem that delivers a meaningful package, his work might become a gift. Whether your work is a gift depends on one thing: whether you are listening to your _genius_. 

The best type of work - the most exciting, the most beautiful, the most motivating - is always a gift.
 
Your _genius_ is calling you, offering up its gifts - so that you can make your life and your work into a gift. Like a tree offering up its flowers, every living being wants to give as part of its growth. These are the true meanings of "being a genius" and "being gifted".

By elevating "those geniuses" above us -- "Yeah he can because he's a genius. There's no way I could" -- we protect our ego from all the hazards of becoming more than we are.

How can you make your work into a gift? If you find the courage to hear your _genius_, you'll discover that you are already are one. Everyone with courage is. In the words of jazz musician Thelonius Monk, "A genius is the one most like himself."
