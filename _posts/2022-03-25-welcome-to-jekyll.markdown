Today is Day 1 of writing about founding my next startup.

It's not Day 1 of starting the startup. I already started over one year ago. 15 1/2 months ago, to be exact, in mid November of 2020.

I'm a perfectionist, so I'm teeing up all the perfect parts for this project to succeed perfectly. Of course this takes a long time.

Often times I get asked, 'So Henry, how do you fund this operation?' The answer is that I don't. I have taken out massive credit card debts; I've accepted thousands of dollars in gifts from my mom; and I've taken out thousands of dollars in loans from my mom. I'm on German unemployment, which pays about €400 a month plus rent.

The circus keeps on going, though. 

What do I want to write about here?

First of all, I want to write the truth. Not "Truth" with a capitol 'T', but the truth as I experience it. Spinoza has a line or two about this. As does Nietzsche. Anyway.

I want to tell my story. I want you to find out what it's really like. And most of all, I want to free you to think about your life in a new way. Because if I can do it, so can you.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
