Nietzsche calls Christianity Platonism for the masses. I watched a mass in Italy a few weeks ago. Mass, it struck me, is a _Gesamtkunstwerk_. It's costume, theater, music, incense, food, therapy, rhetoric, painting, sculpture, and architecture. The _Gesamtkunstwerk_ of mass is the operation of humanity's diverse creative powers to bring the Christian god to life. Truth is power and power is truth: this is what Nietzsche means when he writes that God is dead and we have killed him: God _was_ alive. All our arts brought him to life. Our arts made him true because our arts made him powerful. He lived in our lives, terraforming our thoughts, our beliefs and our actions. While creative expression is power, so is making an emperor kiss your feet. St. Ambrose’s win against Theodosius is also an example making the Christian god powerful. Even today, the pope must meet with presidents. Only a Form that’s powerful can be true. 


Nietzsche exposes the extraordinary creative potential of the Forms and the artist’s role in remixing them. New Forms give us new ways to be human. We can fashion ourselves like Bonsai trees. These diverse artistic powers and potentialities are classically what the humanities taught.

The challenge to the artist and to the humanities is humanity’s thirst for community, which relies on the disciplining of its Forms. While the cultivation/disciplining of Forms are potent for us as individuals, for communities they are life-or-death.

The Jungian archetype of the Shaman, physically weak but spiritually potent, is the creator of the tribe’s communal identity. Tribalism, identity politics, and religious war are necessary to police the borders of the Forms. Charles V knows exactly what he is doing. The Amsterdam Jewish community knows exactly what it’s doing to Spinoza. Islamic radicals are correct to see a threat from modernity. If Catholicism, Judaism or Islam's _Gesamtkunstwerke_ fail to persuade individuals to join the respective communal Forms, then the community must discipline/punish/excise them. The form’s power — the form’s truth — depends upon it. There’s an account from a ship captain who visited Hawaii twenty years after Cook. Where Cook had found a flourishing community, this captain found a broken people. According to one interpretation, the Hawaiians had killed Cook, but Cook, unwittingly, had broken their cosmology. Cook to them was a new and unwitting shaman-artist, whose ship, culture, methods and technologies - many impressive and extraordinary in their potency - dynamited the old forms Hawaiians had used to interpret the cosmos and police their communal forms. Cook's presence destroyed their community.

It is therefore no accident that the patron saints of born-again Paganism, Spinoza and Nietzsche, are loners. They inspire individual artists to become supermen, just as to their communities they are kryptonite. There are no Spinoazan cathedrals. They are artist-rebels, dynamiters, Form-breakers, community-busters. It is in this sense that Carl Schmitt’s dictum is true. He who can make an exception, is sovereign. The artist’s sovereignty is an eternal threat to the community. It is no accident that Plato's Socrates reminds us of "an old quarrel between philosophy and poetry" (_Republic_ 607b5-6). The poet - the artist - is a threat to Plato's imaginary ordered communal project. This is why Plato bans poetry and poets from the ideal city. Every time a community fails to discipline according to its Form, it weakens. A community allowing "free radicals" is like an alka-seltzer tablet in a glass of water. Dissolution is only a matter of time.

Liberalism has been so powerful because it’s loose Forms unleashed great untapped potential in artists (including, say, entrepreneurs) straight-jacketed by earlier Forms. At the same time, 100,000 opioid deaths are the tip of an iceberg of loneliness in modernity's ocean of dissipated communities. Our sharply individual state would have struck earlier human tribes and communities as unnatural and bizarre. The social molecules that once linked — and chained —people together are damaged or missing. What if all modernity’s peculiar psychoses, both individual and mass, flow from this state? This is the sense in which nihilism is still a problem. Our civilization — indeed, all human tribes, no matter how small — developed to include key Forms that gave us, Aristotle’s social animal, community.

How can we cultivate Forms that give people both freedom and community?
